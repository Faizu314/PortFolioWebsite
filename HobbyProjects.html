											<h3>Overview</h3>
											<p>These are some of my projects I worked on in my spare time. I have listed them here chronologically so that you can see where I started from and how I got to where I am.</p>

										<div class="inner">
											<h3>Fluid Simulation (2019)</h3>
											<p>Was very interested in procedural/visual effects and eager to get into them. I thought javascript would be a good idea as I can see a live preview of what I'm doing. I implemented this using navier stokes equation with the help of an old paper. Very quickly moved to shaders after realising that the proper way to do these is using the GPU. (This code is executed on the CPU)</p>

											<h3>Procedural Terrain (2019)</h3>
											<p>One of the first things I tried in Unity was generating terrain procedurally. I have always been fascinated by this subject as a consumer of video games and as a lover of mathematics. In this project I followed a really popular tutorial series by sebastian leaque to get a feel of how experienced people approach this challenge in game development. Even though the terrain was not detailed and had a simple texture, the fact that "code" produced this result using "cold maths" is just heartwarming for me. </p>

											<h3>Cellular Automata (2021)</h3>
											<p>Got really interested in cellular automata when I discovered it. After implementing the basic algorithm I had the idea to use continuous cellular automata to be able to smoothly transition from one biome to another. As I researched this area I went deeper and deeper into the rabbit hole and proposed this as a research idea to my university as a final year project. Sadly that did not work out and I instead worked on a different project (VR Game). However, I am still very motivated to continue this at the appropriate time because these are the kinds of projects I am mostly passionate about.<br><h4>Details</h4>I am using marching squares algorithm which is why the map does not appear as blocky. I also made a correction algorithm which always ensures that no part of the generated map is block off.</p>

											<h3>Softbody Physics (2023)</h3>
											<p>Wanted to implement custom softbody physics but as I was motivated to finish this project fast I used unity's physics system instead. The results were pretty satisfactory for a mobile game. There was no solid game idea direction, I was only motivated to implement softbody mechanics so this project was discontinued.</p>

											<h3>Grapple Mechanics (2023)</h3>
											<p>At this point I was rapid prototyping for hyper casual ideas and made a grapple mechanic.</p>

											<h3>Custom Rope Joint (2023)</h3>
											<p>This is also one of the rapid prototyping idea and I chose to stick with this one for the second hyper casual game. (The first one was Faller <a href="IndieGames.html">See here</a>)</p>

											<h2>Research</h2>
											<h3>Object System (2021-2023)</h3>
											<p>This is the biggest project I have ever worked on and really defines what I want to do in this field. I have worked on this for over 1.5 years and fully plan to continue development but as of now it is still incomplete. <br/><br/>
												In this project I am developing an algorithm to procedurally generate rules that a game uses as its core game mechanics to feature truly replayable and infinite gameplay. This is not an easy task (might even be impossible) but I still choose to invest time in it because it is worth it for me. Over the course of researching this area I had to learn abstract algebra, group theory, computational theory, various algorithms, project management, unit testing and much more. Even though I don't have a prototype to show I still think that this project says more about me than anything else I have worked on.
