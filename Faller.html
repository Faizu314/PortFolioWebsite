									<h3>What I learned</h3>
									<p>I believe the 24 days of developing this game were the most valuable of my career as a game developer. I will try to be brief but the most useful subjects were; planning and scoping a project, game audio design, game music, level design, balancing, polishing, implementing ads etc. I was very happy with the results as they demonstrated that I am capable of planning a project and finishing it on time. Additionally, I also separated out any system that could be reused in the next project. This was a great addition to my gamedev toolkit. </p>

									<h3>Challenges Faced</h3>
									<p>This was really as simple as a game can be <b>But</b> that does not mean that the engineering has to be of low quality. The most interesting system was the save and load system. Although this was a very simple task, I wanted to use a save system that could fullfil two requirements, it should be reusable in other projects and it should be easily extended or changed in the later versions. For me engineering solutions to these kinds of problems is the best part of game development, I was able to deliver on these requirements in time and have uploaded this as a package in my Unity Library repository. (Click <a href="https://github.com/Faizu314/Phezu/tree/main/Assets/com.phezu.datasystem" target="_blank">here</a> to see)</p>

												<p>Designing the application flow was also an interesting challenge. I eventually ended up using a state machine and a state machine based event system that dictated the core flow of the game. My reasons for settling on this design was to make the events as intuitive and simple as possible. I uploaded this as two packages, one for scene management and one as a hyper casual template (because the flow of the game is specific to this genre).</p>
